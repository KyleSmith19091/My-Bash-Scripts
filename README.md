# My-Bash-Scripts
My shell scripts are solutions to problems that I found tedious in my use of the terminal. I created these scripts
as way to streamline and increase my productivity in the terminal

# What is there?
- C++ Run command
- Weather forcast script
- Clear downloads folder script
- A versatile script to quickly open config files
- A script to create an empty C++ project and open my editor
- Tmux Startup script for development
- Tmux script to show off how cool my terminal looks

## Let's start off with C++
This is a script that I wrote because I found it extremely irritating having to first run

    ```
    g++ -Wall -Werror -lsomelib myfile.cpp -o main 
    ./main
    ```
So I condensed this and so much more into one easy command.
This script can
1. Run a simple makefile project
2. Execute a C++ project with header files
3. Execute a C++ project with library files
